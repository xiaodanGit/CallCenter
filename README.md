CallCenter
==========
Implement a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager and diretor. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free.
if the respondent cannot handel the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it,
then the call should be escalated to a director. Design the clases and dta structures for this problem.
